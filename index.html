        Hi, My name is Rizky Syaiful! :)<br>
        Know me more, so I may help you better. ;)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        Basically, I love humanity as a whole.<br>Their current miseries & gloomy future often bring me tears.<br>I spend a lot of time thinking about them.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;" >
        And, the equation below describes me very well...

        <p class="image-caption">These are the reasons I enjoy being an innovation consultant.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;" >
        So, I might help you: digging your own WHYs, strengthening your organization with innovative culture & process, reducing the amount of loophole in your next strategic product move, being stuck together in your problem & brainstorming the solution, train your team to be more innovative <span style="color: grey">(with creative thinking & scientist mindset)</span>, teach your team the latest breakthroughs <span style="color: grey">(Bitcoin, blockchain, AI, etc.)</span> or innovation fundamentals <span style="color: grey">(what is internet, computer, money, society, government, human needs, etc.)</span>. <strong>TL:DR; I can either teach you or simply rent my brain</strong>.

        Here're the shadows of my brain content: my essays, my YouTube Channels, my past actions.

    <p style="text-align:center;" >
        At 2007, in my 2nd year senior high school,<br>
        I submitted <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/1FoRBzFiOWtoRAf713E21ZXwZ9gb3ZE4_E0wTDKejzVVasuaRVGc1KuILq-aI/edit">this business proposal</a> to a competition held by ministry.<br>
        My idea:<br>Udemy-like,<br>but focus on teaching money-generating skills,<br>distributed by VCD/DVD.<br>Remember, YouTube wasn't even a thing back then.<br>
        (I didn't win, in case you wondering.)
      </p>
    
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        So no surprise, at 2016, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Zo_aHxvrI&list=PLMj6ao6FLBWTgfVv7drY4Z18b8vegdlyv">created a YouTube video series</a><br>
        on how to live as happy as children.<br>My first advice: be logistically secured&mdash;or financially independent as the adult called it.<br>
        (I pause the video update. Because I want to make some passive assets,<br> so that I give real examples on the following episode.)
      </p>
    
      <p style="text-align:center;" >
        In 2014, I launched a pet project called Wikikandidat.<br>
        The goal is to reduce political cost like campaign, lobbying, etc.<br>
        By providing a student-guarded wiki of election nominees.<br>
        (We <a href="https://wikikandidat.tumblr.com/post/82547489919/manfaat-kami-di-pemilu-legislatif-2014-jumlah">got 25.928 users at legislative election</a>&mdash;not much at other election.<br>This project is no longer running. Call me if you want the software to power other project.)
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center;" >
        In 2019-2020, I co-initiated an internal feedback software with my colleagues at Alterra.<br>It's called <a href="http://po-box.alterra.id/">PO Box</a>. It covers both positive & constructive feedback.<br>
        (We increase the Gallup survey result about appreciation/recognition by 13% in one semester.)

          Do you like my brain content? It doesn't have to be a business inquiry to start a conversation.<br>;)<br>Let's discuss a better future for humanity!
